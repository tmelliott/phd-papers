# Predicting arrival time

## Particle filter etas

* use particle filter and network state to obtain ETA estiamtes for each particle/stop
* include dwell time uncertainties, etc
* result is a distribution estimated by $N$ particles

## Simplified ETA CDF

* round to minutes
* compute the CDF by definition ``number of particles arriving within $x$ minutes''
