\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Bus arrival-time prediction is far from a novel concept: 
ever since the first vehicle tracking technology was implemented
in transit vehicles in the late 1980's, 
real-time models have been implemented to provide \gls{rti} for commuters.
The simplest form of this is, the \gls{eta}
(usually displayed as \emph{minutes until arrival}),
was implemented in {{region}} by \cite{Wall99analgorithm} 
using their proposed \gls{kf} algorithm.
In their work, they used historical data to obtain \glspl{eta}.

Over the years, advances in computing power have enabled new
modeling approaches,
such as support vector machines \citep


\section{GTFS network construction}
\label{sec:gtfs}

Before we can usefully model buses in real-tim{}e, 
we need to construct a \emph{transit network},
consisting of \emph{intersections} (nodes)
connected by \emph{road segments} (edges).
In this way, each \emph{route} 
(a journey taken by a transit vehicle, from an origin to a destination by a fixed path)
can be represented as a sequence of road segments,
each of which we model as vehicles travel along them (see section~\ref{sec:kf}).




\section{Real-time vehicle model}
\label{sec:pf}

The real-time vehicle model that runs ... in real time?


\section{Network model}
\label{sec:kf}

Two parts to this - first, the prior prediction step; then, the data update step.
