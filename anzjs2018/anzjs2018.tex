\begin{abstract}
Predicting the arrival time of a transit vehicle involves not only
knowledge of its current position and schedule adherence,
but also of traffic conditions along the remainder of the route.
Road networks are dynamic, 
and can change from free-flowing to highly congested very quickly,
which impacts the arrival time of transit vehicles,
particularly buses which often share the road with other vehicles,
so reliable predictions need to account for \rt and future traffic conditions.
The first step in this process is to construct a framework with which road state
(traffic conditions) can be estimated using \rt transit vehicle position data.
We propose a framework which implements a vehicle model using a particle filter
to estimate travel times along roads,
used by a second model to estimate \rt traffic conditions which can
later be used for arrival time prediction.
We demonstrate the \rt feasibility of such an approach in \rt,
and detail our implementation in R and C++.
Development and testing took place in Auckland, New Zealand,
with future work planned to incorporate historical data into the network model
to improve the reliability of ETAs.
