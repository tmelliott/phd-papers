\begin{abstract}
Predicting transit vehicle arrival time is a somewhat complex procress.
Road networks are dynamic, and can change from free-flowing to highly congested
very quickly.
Any reliable prediction framework needs to be able to respond to these changes,
but also to future trends, such as typical changes to traffic flow
at peak times, based on hisorical data.
Of course, the major constraint on any prediction framework is going to be
computational efficiency.
Due to the realtime nature of the problem, predictions need to be 
available as soon as possible after observing the vehicles' positions,
which are updated approximately every 30~seconds.
In this paper, we describe our C++ implementation of a particle filter to estimate
vehicle state in combination with a network state model,
allowing us to model transit vehicle flow through the network.
While our application here is being testing in Auckland, New Zealand,
we hope that our methods are general enough to be applied to any
transit network that uses GTFS.
Preliminary results show that, with suitable hardware,
the framework is fast enough while retaining the complexity necessary
to incorporate as much information as necessary to predict arrival times.
