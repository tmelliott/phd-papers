\section{Implementing in realtime}
\label{sec:rt}

How we implement it, choice of software (Rcpp = R + C++).
R: dealing with data structures is easier, maintainability, interfacing
C++: speed

Overall structure:
- load
- fetch positions
- initialize or mutate+update
- update network
- make ETA predictions (vehicle state + network state)

Some of the key things:
- minimise copy, parallelisation using OMP
- moving as much computation ``outside'' of the main loop as possible
  (e.g., ``pre''-predict vehicle/network states so only update required)
  so ETAs are generated ASAP after retrieving data
- keeping the GTFS database up-to-date by fetching new data each morning
- distribution - a cloud database vs a single protobuf file with everything 
  (maintenance/reliability/speed/size)
