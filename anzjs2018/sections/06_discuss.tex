\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}

It all seems to work (hopefully I don't need to change this D:)

Next steps include
- generating useful priors for ``fall back'' (i.e., no data, future) prediction
- develop and implement a more complex network update model (correlations, etc)
- prediction estimates (point vs interval)
